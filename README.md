# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

## step 12. 1

- Abhinav’s notes: made a folder called Lab 1.
- Keaton’s Notes: I had issues initially with git-hub recognized my
  account name and email. Was able to complete this by correctly
  associating within the terminal.
- Kate’s notes: prerequisites completed
- Trey’s notes: I made sure to have everything installed properly and
  introduced myself to Git.

## step 12.2

- Abhinav’s notes: Made a repo on Github for Team 5. Then coppied the
  html link of the repo from Github
- Keaton’s notes: Repo was created prior so I only had to create new
  file add the green code button over.
- Kate’s notes: repo created for Lab 1 Team 5
- Trey’s notes: The repo was already created so i did nothing for this
  step besides copying the clone URL.

## step 12.3

- Abhinav’s notes: I changed the directory to Lab 1 in the terminal.
  Then cloned the repo by typing git clone
  <https://github.com/DS202-at-ISU/s2026-ds2020-lab1-team5lab1.git>.
  After doing that I opened the project in RStudios. Then opened the
  README.Rmd to make changes to the readme.
- Keaton’s Notes - Had no issues creating the new project
- Kate’s notes: cloned GitHub repo to my computer with RStudio
- Trey’s notes: I successfully cloned the test Github repo to my
  computer.

# step 12.4

- Abhinav’s notes: made local changes to the Readme. Added a line called
  “Abhinav’s notes: This is a line from RStudio” and saved the file.
  After saving the file, I did get add . to add all the changes files.
  Then I typed git commit -m “Step 12.2 done by Abhinav” to commit all
  the changes.
- Keaton’s name - Initially struggled with location the commit button
  but was able to find it.
- Kate’s notes: This is a line from RStudio
- Trey’s notes: This is a line from RStudio

# step 12.5

- Abhinav’s notes: After commiting all my changes, I pushed it to github
  by typing git push origin main. So this would push it straight to the
  main branch in the repo in github.
- Keaton’s notes - Issues when pushing the different additions due to
  each member working and pushing at the same time. We worked through it
  by each pushing at different moments and waiting to add our updates
  till others were done.
- Kate’s notes: changes pushed online to GitHub. We had issues with
  pushing new commits without pulling teammates’ prior commits. We fixed
  that by making sure we had pulled first before pushing.
- Trey’s notes: We encountered issues when multiple team members tried
  to push changes at the same time. To solve this we made sure to take
  turns pulling everything and then pushing our new changes.

# step 12.6

- Abhinav’s notes: After pushing the changes, I chcked the repo to see
  if my changes got pushed and it did. There was a commit and the change
  was that I added “Abhinav’s notes: this is a line from RStudio” in the
  README.Rmd.
- Keaton’s notes - Had no issues when finally solving the problems in
  12.5 as it connected properly.
- Kate’s notes: README updated with commits from team members
- Trey’s notes: Checked the repo in my browser and it looked like the
  changes went through with no issues
